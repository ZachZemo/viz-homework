I've saved 3 figures in these two scripts which help identify and compare the diabetes data set!
First was the pairsplot. Which is a lot to digest just looking at it on the surface.
Second, I made the heatmap. This to me was a much more revealing figure, because i was able to determine something right away if anything at all! That was that the HDL and TCH are highly correlated whereas the other columns see low to mid level correlation. 
Third, I made a figure that showed a histogram of every column on one page. This was a good indicator of the level of each column but didn't tell me much in terms of how they compared/interacted with each other. 
Overall, I would say the heatmap offered the best visual representation.
